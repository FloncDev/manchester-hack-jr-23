## About the Project
<hr>
In summary, this project is a financial education website, where the user can learn about investing in stocks through on-hands practice, utilising fake, virtual currency in the world's existent stock market in real-time. 
<br>
<br>

### The User
<hr>
Each user registered into our database is given upmost confidentiality, every user's session token and password is encrypted by the industry standard, cryptographically secure, hashing algorithm known as argon2.
<br>
<br>
Additionally, this project utilises virtual, made-up currency. The user is not at financial risk in any way, shape or form. If the user were to lose any or all finance provided within the project, the user may restart from the starting balance, as a result any stock owned (unsold) before restarting will also be discarded.

### Buying

In this project, the user is able to select as many stocks or shares to buy, at any time.
The only factor limiting the user is their financial value! As the user learns more and more about stocks and the market, they will be able to earn more out of their investments, and either invest more or remain neutral in order to dominate the rankings*(see below).

## Leaderboard
<hr>
In order to add more content into the project that the user can engage with, we have added a ranking system. The users that have signed up can actively compete against eachother for the title of the greatest investor within our project's reality-based simulation (bragging rights are included). The leaderboard functions by sorting the users in descending order, the largest portfolio value to the lowest. This creates a ranking from the most prosperous user to the least valued user. This
