## About the Project
<hr>
In summary, this project is a financial education website, where the user can learn about investing in stocks through on-hands practice, utilising fake, virtual currency in the world's existent stock market in real-time. 
<br>
<br>

### The User
<hr>
Each user registered into our database is given upmost confidentiality, every user's session token and password is encrypted by the industry standard, cryptographically secure, hashing algorithm known as argon2.
<br>
<br>
Additionally, this project utilises virtual, made-up currency. The user is not at financial risk in any way, shape or form. If the user were to lose any or all finance provided within the project, the user may restart from the starting balance, as a result any stock owned (unsold) before restarting will also be discarded.
